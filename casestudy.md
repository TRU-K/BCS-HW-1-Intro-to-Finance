# Till. Payments Case Study

## Description
Till. Payments (TP) is an Australian FinTech business that specialises in taking the hard work out of incorporating merchant point of sale (POS) and online payment integration within businesses. TP was founded back in 2012 by Shadi Haddad who is currently still operating as CEO. The business is operating within the domain of merchant services. This field has for a long time been dominated by the big 4 banks (CBA, ANZ, Westpac and NAB) but recently there has been an abundant of other companies emerging to better accomodate businesses than what was previously availible.

The company had humble beginnings starting out innovating, unattended payment for parking meters. This grew to operate in over 500 cities worldwide. The business then building of off its already established infrastructure, expanded its horizons to focus on the needs of the merchant, in particularly how they receive payments for goods and services. TP observed a halt in the innovation of technology required for businesses to receive payments. The process for merchants and consumers, was not as fluid as it should be. TP is focusing on ways to create a simple, seamless and fluent process for merchants to integrate their services and begin receiving payments.

TP has established good infrastructure, coming from not only Haddad’s entrepreneurism and business skills, but thanks to many investors who have invested the funds to make this business venture possible. In total the investment pool has now reached a value of over 145 million dollars (AUD) coming from investors such as, Avenir Growth, Woodson Capital, Akuna Capital and touch venture. The current funding is going to be used fund general operations and help further their international growth.

## What Does Till Have To Offer?
TP is directly targeting merchants of any size as the technology they have designed is highly scalable and is currently suitable for businesses of small-medium size. TP is giving businesses the power of “delivering on the demands of their digitally connected customers." This is important as it is something that many of the major service providers in this domain do not deliver on. Instead playing a never-ending game of catchup, copying the features smaller companies innovate and have brought into the world. The tech and some features TP has to offer are discussed below.
