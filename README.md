# BCS-HW-1-Intro-to-Finance
## Background
As a FinTech professional, it is critical to learn how FinTech companies start, evolve, and grow, and to be able to speak knowledgeably about the major players in the FinTech space. Even those in a highly technical role must stay abreast of what is happening in the business landscape, as many FinTech companies create tools and technologies that are then used by other companies.

One of the key methods used to conduct corporate analysis is the **case study**. Case studies are often 50–100 pages or more, but your task is to create a more focused case study that analyzes how an Australian or global FinTech company is responding to the problems and needs of the FinTech domain it is in, and how it is using technology to solve a standing financial problem.

In this homework assignment, you will:

* Select a FinTech domain that interests you, and then choose an Australian or global FinTech company or project within that domain.

* Research the domain and company.

* Write a detailed case study of the company.

* Upload your case study to your git repository.

This assignment will challenge you to polish your FinTech research skills by accessing reports, publications, and online resources that FinTech professionals use to evaluate the industry.

It will also help you situate the techniques and technologies you will be mastering in this course––e.g., machine learning, Python, modeling, blockchain––within the real world of global FinTech. Finally, it will give you practice presenting and speaking about FinTech strategy and technology.
